# RoomScheduler
This was my final project for CMPSC221 in Fall 2020. 

This code utilizes a three tier design, where the GUI, functional classes, and the database exist separately. 

CMPSC221 has been one of my favorite courses at Penn State, and by the end of the class I was much more confident with both Java and SQL.
